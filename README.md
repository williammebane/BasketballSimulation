# BasketballSimulation

Goal #1: to familiarize myself with C# syntax and design.

Goal #2: work on a fun side project and see how well my model performs compared to leading NBA simulation models

The project is designed to allow the user to enter two NBA teams and run a simulation of a game in an attempt to predict each chance's of winning.  Initially, the project will use high-level and basic statistics about each team to run a very general simulation which likely won't be accurate.  As the project progresses, the simulation will break down the game into many events (i.e. a rebound, shot, etc) and simulate each individually in order to more accurately predict the outcome of the game.

All statistics and team information is currently gathered from an external Web API (probasketballapi.com)
